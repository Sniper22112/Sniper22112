- Yo! I am Sniper221102, a 17 year old college student currently studying my second year in games design.
- Within this course are things such as; Coding, Modelling, Animation, Art and VFX, although I am most passionate about coding.
- I did initially learn coding in C++, but have transferred my skills into LUAU in order to program roblox games!
- As of right now, I have not worked on any projects, but I am certainly looking to change that.
- Therefore, if you like what you see on my portfolio be sure to hit me up at "sniper22112" on discord.
